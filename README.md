### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer currently enrolled in the <strong>ALX Software Engineering program</strong>, building a strong foundation in backend systems, real-world projects, and clean coding principles.

💡 I got into software engineering to <strong>impact lives through tech</strong> and build a <strong>financially stable lifestyle</strong>. My mission is to create solutions that serve communities, empower others, and solve real-world problems.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On

I'm currently building a REST API to support a <strong>school management system for rural areas</strong> where online access is limited.  
The system will handle:
- ✅ Student Registration  
- 📆 Attendance Tracking  
- 📩 SMS-based Parent Notifications

I believe in using tech for social good, and this project is just one of many steps in that direction.
